## Features

-The first phase is designing of questionnaire and data collection. 

-The initial portion of the questionnaire focuses on parental study for finding the trigged features by reviewing 
    
    -antenatal 
    -perinatal and 
    -infant hazard factors of ASD. 

-The second phase is to apply machine learning techniques on the collected instances to develop prediction models and identify the reasons to ASD. 

-While collecting the data, samples are obtained for both subjects with ASD and those categorized as non-ASD. This enables the data mining techniques to identify the difference between the two groups. A total of 115 features are obtained from each subject. 

-The collected dataset has 47% sample of the subjects with ASD.
