% function classhypo = KNN(features_train,features_test,labels_train,k,weighted)
% 
% Performs KNN classification to a set of data points using a given
% training data and the associated class labels.
%
%   Inputs:
%       features_train:      N x F matrix containing the training data, 
%                               where N is the number of samples
%                               and F is the number of features.
%       features_test:       M x F matrix containing the classification data, 
%                               where M is the number of samples
%                               and F is the number of features.
%       labels_train:        N x 1 vector of integer class labels for training
%                               samples
%       k:                   number of nearest neighbors used in the
%                               classification (can be a vector)
%       weighted:            weight nearest neighbor counts by the inverse of 
%                               class frequencies estimated from the training
%                               data? (0/1, default: 1).
